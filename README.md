# EE5BoomBox3

The codebase of the boombox project.

To finish our bachelors degree in ict and electronics engineering we build a Bluetooth speaker.
The project was around 50% hardware development and 50% software development.
Using a stm32 and freertos we developed different threads that handled UI, Bluetooth and audio stream. 

Here a video of one of the last updates send to our professor.
